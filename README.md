# Modelling-Housing-Prices-with-Bayesian-Mixture-Models
In this project, Gibbs sampling has been used to fit a Finite Gaussian Mixture Model to the median housing values of the Boston dataset in R. We fit 4 models with different number of components to the data and accept the model with the best predictive density plot and least DIC value. The preliminary idea obtained from EDA is supported by the fitted model.
